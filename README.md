# ConciseAlgoTemplate
A collection of concise algo templates for programing contest. (Not for projects)

I dedicated to creating a set of algorithmic templates that are easy to read and use. So, you won't see too much projectized code as you read.

## Forms of templates

The templates I uploaded will all be structs. For functions that operate at intervals, the arguments l and r are left-closed and right-open. (Like this: [l, r))

## Naming

In the naming of variables, functions and classes, I have tried to follow the common naming in the algorithm competition field.

## Notes

Please note that since this project has only just begun, I have not yet explained in detail what each function does. But it should be self-explanatory.
