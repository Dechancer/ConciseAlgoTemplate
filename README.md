# ConciseAlgoTemplate
A collection of concise algo templates for programing contest. (Not for projects)

I dedicated to creating a set of algorithmic templates that are easy to read and use. So, you won't see too much projectized code as you read.

In the naming of variables, functions and classes, I have tried to follow the common naming in the competition field.

Please note that since this project has only just begun, I have not yet explained in detail what each function does.
