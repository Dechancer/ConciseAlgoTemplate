# ConciseAlgoTemplates

A collection of concise algo templates for programing contest. (Not for projects)

I dedicated to creating a set of algorithmic templates that are easy to read and use. So, you won't see too much projectized code as you read.

## How to use

These templates are more like snippets, so "ctrl + c" and "ctrl + v" and few code changes would work.

## Forms of templates

The templates I uploaded will all be structs. For functions that operate at intervals, the arguments l and r are left-closed and right-open. (Like this: [l, r))

## Naming

In the naming of variables, functions and classes, I have tried to follow the common naming in the algorithm competition field.

## Notes

Please note that since this project has only just begun, I have not yet explained in detail what each function does. But it should be self-explanatory.
And the cpp standard is at least c++17.

Special thanks to Jiangly from Beijing University for his code implementation help.
